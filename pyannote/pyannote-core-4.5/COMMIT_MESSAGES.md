# Commit Message Conventions

> This page defines a convention for commit messages for [pyannote](http://github.com/pyannote) related projects.
>
> All commits pushed to the [pyannote](https://github.com/pyannote) repositories must conform to that convention.

The contens of this page are partly based on the [angular commit messages document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit?pli=1).


## Purpose

The commit message is what is what describes your contribution. 
Its purpose must therefore be to document what a commit contributes to a project. 

Its head line __should__ be as meaningful as possible because it is always 
seen along with other commit messages.

Its body __should__ provide information to comprehend the commit for people 
who care. 

Its footer __may__ contain references to external artifacts 
(issues it solves, related commits) as well as breaking change notes.

This applies to __all kind of projects__.


## Format

#### Short form (only subject line)

    <type>(<scope>): <subject>

#### Long form (with body)

    <type>(<scope>): <subject>
    
    <BLANK LINE>
  
    <body>
    
    <BLANK LINE>
    
    <footer>

First line cannot be longer than __70 characters__, second line is always blank and other lines should be wrapped at __80 characters__! This makes the message easier to read on github as well as in various git tools.

### Subject Line

The subject line contains succinct description of the change.

#### Allowed <type>

 * feat (feature)
 * fix (bug fix)
 * docs (documentation)
 * style (formatting, missing semi colons, ï¿½)
 * refactor
 * test (when adding missing tests)
 * chore (maintain)
 * improve (improvement, e.g. enhanced feature)

#### Allowed <scope>

Scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change.

#### <subject> text

 * use imperative, present tense: _change_ not _changed_ nor _changes_ or _changing_
 * do not capitalize first letter
 * do not append dot (.) at the end

### Message Body

 * just as in <subject> use imperative, present tense: _change_ not _changed_ nor _changes_ or _changing_
 * include motivation for the change and contrast it with previous behavior

### Message Footer

#### Breaking changes

All breaking changes have to be mentioned in footer with the description of the change, justification and migration notes

    BREAKING CHANGE: Id editing feature temporarily removed
    
        As a work around, change the id in XML using replace all or friends

#### Referencing issues

Closed bugs / feature requests / issues should be listed on a separate line in the footer prefixed with "Closes" keyword like this:
 
    Closes #234

or in case of multiple issues:
 
    Closes #123, #245, #992

## FAQ for Geeks

##### Why to use imperative form in commit messages?
I.e. why to use _add test for #foo_ versus _added test for #foo_ or _adding test for foo_?

Makes commit logs way more readable. See the work you did during a commit as a work on an issue and the commit as solving that issue. Now write about for what issue the commit is a result rather than what you did or are currently doing. 

__Example:__ You write a test for the function #foo. You commit the test. You use the commit message _add test for #foo_. Why? Because that is what the commit solves.

##### How to categorize commits which are direct follow ups to merges?
Use `chore(merge): <what>`.

##### I want to commit a micro change. What should I do?
Ask yourself, why it is only a micro change. Use feat = _docs_, _style_ or _chore_ depending on the change of your merge. Please see next question if you consider commiting work in progress.

##### I want to commit work in progress. What should I do?
Do not do it or do it (except for locally) or do it on a non public branch (ie. non master / develop ...) if you need to share the stuff you do.

When you finished your work, [squash](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) the changes to commits with reasonable commit messages and push them on a public branch.
